 * Provides methods to sort arrays of objects. Sorting requires working memory
 * and this class allows that memory to be reused to avoid allocation. The
 * sorting is otherwise identical to the Arrays.sort methods (uses timsort).<br>
 * <br>
 * Note that sorting primitive arrays with the Arrays.sort methods does not
 * allocate memory (unless sorting large arrays of char, short, or byte).
